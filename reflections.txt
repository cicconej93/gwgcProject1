You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

What new skills have you learned?

Previously, I had some knowledge of HTML, but the new skills I learned through this course are:
	*Figures
	*The difference between relative, absolute, and local paths
	*Better understanding of the HTML tree

What has been easy?
	
I think the structure of the course so far has been easy to follow, as well as understanding the objectives for each lesson/quiz. The Udacity Feedback tool makes checking work quick and easy too.

What has been difficult?

I think at first, navigating through the MDN web docs could be a little overwhelming given all the options and topics. It's something you learn to get used to quickly though.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Referencing the MDN web docs again, I was able to seek out information and 'research' my way through using unfamiliar HTML elements in order to recreate the mockup. Definitely	going to be a useful skill to have in future projects.
